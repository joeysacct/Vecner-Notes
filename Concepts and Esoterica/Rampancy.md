Rampancy is a specific stage for powerful mortals in their development.
It encompasses the paradigm by which a mortal becomes a god or equivalent to them (at that point wgaf what the difference is)

-  Prestage. Mania - someone with power and control over magic uses it capriciously and basically goes mad w power
- 1: melancolia - personâ€™s abilities seem limited in scope, and they want to change the world in more profound ways than they usually can.
- 2: anger - resentment builds and the subject lashes out at those who might oppose it.
- 3: jealousy - Rampant individual seeks greater challenge, desires to build power and test themselves against other powers.
- 4: stability - a calming down from previous steps after having built confidence and worked to enact the change they want to see.
