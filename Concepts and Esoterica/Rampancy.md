Rampancy is a specific stage for powerful mortals in their development.
It encompasses the paradigm by which a mortal becomes a god or equivalent to them (at that point wgaf what the difference is)

Stages:    
-  Prestage. Mania - **someone with power and control over magic uses it capriciously and basically goes mad w power**
- 1: melancolia - **personâ€™s abilities seem limited in scope, and they want to change the world in more profound ways than they usually can.**
- 2: ANGER:
Anger precipitates from a being's desire for power and the ability to break free from their bonds of mortal life. This usually dictates a more literal rampage of their power, gaining more and more of it, finding the shape their powers will naturally take based on their abilities. Despair grows greatly during this period, but serves as fuel for the Rampage. This Rampage still remains limited, however, and typically out of the purview of the Gods, at least for now. 
(stages below are joeyguesses)
- 3: jealousy - Rampant individual seeks greater challenge, desires to build power and test themselves against other powers.
- 4: stability - a calming down from previous steps after having built confidence and worked to enact the change they want to see.
- 5: godhood - there you go.
