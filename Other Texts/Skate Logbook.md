## The Box:

Inside you find a small logbook, a key, and a note. The logbook is a small, short book with leather binding. Embossed on the front is gold leaf lettering, which says "The Skate". The key looks like a simple iron key, with carvings of very strange runes along the loop of the key. The shape of the key's teeth also appears strange, almost like they are too short for any standard lock. The note is simple parchment, and is folded in half.

### The Note:

To whomever is unfortunate enough to now read this letter, 

  

I implore you to let sleeping dogs lie. This key and this book, wherever it may be from, have brought nothing but strife to me. They will certainly do the same to you.

  

[[Lord Soth|L.S.]]

# The Logbook: 

#### Note in front sleeve:

Naval Archive # 00317-H, "Recovered from vessel, 88 miles north of Grimsey. Logbook ends abruptly. All crew missing. Condition of the vessel: intact. No signs of violence. All clocks stopped at 02:47."

#### Entry 01 -- Departure

Date: 13-2-857 PF

Captain: K. Mervan  

Clear skies. Supplies loaded. Crew in well spirits. Bound for the Cloven Strait. Icefields reported thin this time of year. Crossing expected to be routine.  

- Cpt. Mervan

#### Entry 02 -- Thin Ice

Date: 13-5-857 PF

Spotted first icebergs. Boreal lights are unusually strong. Quartermaster reports compasses fluctuating; attributes to magnetic interference. Weather remains stable. Small fissure in port rudder gear casing. Repairs pending.  

- Mervan

#### Entry 03 -- Something Beneath; Shaken Crew

Date: 13-8-857 PF

Felt a shift under the hull at 03:12. Small impact, no damage. Just something passed beneath us. Likely just a denser glacier hunk. Entire crew on edge, after the sinking of The Haifisch. Ice readings indicate the depth near impossible for any trench this far north. Typical faulty equipment those shitbags give us.  

- Mervan

#### Entry 04 -- Whispers 

Date: 13-9-857 PF

Nightly Anchor watch recently reported whispers coming from the ice. Multiple crew members on watch confirm. Navigation Officer Rill claimed to hear his name being spoken from beneath the ship. Evidence of delusion, morale affected. Need to find the source. Cabin fever maybe? Or Scurvy? Engineer Herro has requested a physician at next port of call. 

- Mervan

#### Entry 05 -- Losing Track of Time

Date: 13-10-857 PF (?)  

Chronometers disagree. Half the watches report midday; others show deep night. Crew disoriented. Mainspring on bridge clock unwound itself. Cook insists we’ve skipped a day entirely. Says he woke to a stove full of ash and stew already cold. These men’s paranoia is getting the better of them. Must keep morale up. 

- Mervan

#### Entry 06 -- Frost Inside

Date: 

Ice has started forming on the inside of the ship’s walls. Not from leaks. Perfect crystals blooming across bulkheads, forming some kind of shapes no one recognizes. They melt when touched, but return in different shapes elsewhere. Wish we had the equipment, and willpower, to study what this is.

- Mervan

#### Entry 07 -- “He Is Listening”

Date: 

Found etched into bunkroom mirror in reverse script:

“He is listening from under the ice.”

No signs of forced entry. All knives inventoried. Someone maybe scratched it with something else. Navigator Jel muttered something in his sleep. Not a word of it we know. Not in the charts, like he usually does. Need to find the culprit. Psychosis might have taken hold in one of our own. 

- Mervan

#### Entry 08 -- Blood in the Ice

Date: 

Discovered red ice beneath starboard bow. Icepick retrieved a sample. Not blood. Not water neither. Sample shrank when exposed to heat, gave off a sound, like a sigh. Quartermaster locked himself in pantry. Won’t speak. Cries at night. Says “we brought this on us.” These men are losing their minds. We need a way out of the ice soon. Will request support via transduction tomorrow. 

- Mervan

#### Entry 09 -- Footsteps on the Hull

Date: 

Night watch reported footsteps above, but deck was empty. Fresh boot prints appeared across the wheelhouse ceiling in the snow. Voices now constant. Same whisper, again and again:

“He wants to see.” I fear mutiny, or worse. I locked the helm. Nothing on the transducer. Silence spells the worst. Someone is losing it. I hope it’s not me. 

- Cpt. Mervin

#### Final Entry -- Torn Page

The last page of the logbook is torn horizontally. Only a partial note remains:

"...we were wrong. It’s not beneath the sea. The sea is just its breath. The ice is its skin. We drilled through its name… and now..."

  

Then nothing. Just salt-stained paper.
