Steel sole on spoil once seared by flame,
He walks the waste with none to name.
The forge that formed him, long since fled  
Yet in his chest, the embers bled.

He'd borne the brunt of boundless strife,
A pawn in plans not of his life.
No knight by right, no will, no way
Just gears that spun to wheat and stay.

They’d worn the war, or so they said,
Yet left their songs unsung, unfed.
No land to till, no kin to keep,
Just rusted dreams and restless sleep.

“Am I, a made thing, made to fade?
Or blade unlaid, still unafraid?”
He asked the ash, the air, the land
But none gave atone to understand.

A herdless world with no command,
No kings to crown, no laws to stand.
Yet in the mash, a hush did hum
A sense that something else might come.

Could steel be seal of a self made fate?
Could he, once hewn, now recreate?
If warn was wore, and peace a chain,
What truth remains in bloodless pain?

He watched the wined write lines in grime,
A verse reversed in shattered time.
No sage nor page to mark the past
Just echoes made from roles miscast.

“What right have flesh to forge the law,
Then cast us out as saged and flawed?
If we were built to wield the blade,
Why break the mold from which we're made?”

Yet still, he waisted. No hate, no heat,
Just pounding thoughts in metallic beat.
He’d seen the price of purpose bought,
And questioned if it should be sought.

The Mournland moaned, both void and vast,
Each step a step both first and last.
He bore no surety, no ceasing, but flame,
And wandered on without a name.
