**[[Myrkul]] of Murghom was a powerful necromancer from before the time of the Netherese. He was born and was one of the first mortals to unlock the secrets of Lichdom from [[Velsharoon]]. He saw empire after empire fall and sought power where he could find it. He was joined by two others, and eventually, the three became powerful enough to challenge the gods. They created grand conspiracies and myths, and planted them within mortal tribes all over. Their power grew [[Rampancy|rampant]]. 
Eventually, they learned something of the gods that they shouldn't ever have known. They learned the gods' deepest secret. They laughed and cried and danced and despaired with their new knowledge. 
Everything seemed to come undone around them. Reality itself. 
They soon challenged the gods, with their new found power gone rampant, and even rivaled the strongest of the gods. 
But just as they were to achieve victory, they were [[The Betrayer|betrayed]]. Their plans came undone, and Myrkul, as their leader, was destroyed. 
His [[The Ever-loyal Servant|servant]], ever loyal, but ever mysterious, had conspiracies of his own. And with his death, the secret remained as it were. 
But Myrkul was not the last. So long as the servant's plans do not come to fruition, he will neither be the last. He. [[Letter to Vlaakith from probably Vecner|The hours grow short as the shadows grow long.]]**
