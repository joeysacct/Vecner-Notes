- Parable of [[Myrkul]] mentioned. [[Myrkul]] that mf from baldur’s gate

- [[Myrkul]] of Murghom was a powerful necromancer from before the time of the [[Netheril|Netherese]]. He was born and was one of the first mortals to unlock the secrets of Lichdom from Velsharoon. He saw empire after empire fall and sought power where he could find it. He was joined by two others, and eventually, the three became powerful enough to challenge the gods. They created grand conspiracies and myths, and planted them within mortal tribes all over. Their power grew [[Rampancy|rampant]]. Eventually, they learned something of the gods that they shouldn't ever have known. They learned the gods' deepest secret. They laughed and cried and danced and despaired with their new knowledge. Everything seemed to come undone around them. Reality itself. They soon challenged the gods, with their new found power gone [[Rampancy|rampant]], and even rivaled the strongest of the gods. But just as they were to achieve victory, they were betrayed. Their plans came undone, and [[Myrkul]], as their leader, was destroyed. His servant, ever loyal, but ever mysterious, had conspiracies of his own. And with his death, the secret remained as it were. But [[Myrkul]] was not the last. So long as the servant's plans do not come to fruition, he will neither be the last. He. The hours grow short as the shadows grow long.
