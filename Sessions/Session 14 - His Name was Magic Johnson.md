## Places Visited

- Same place we were last time homeskillet
    

## Events

- WE find a book, “Dissertations on the Abstruse Mind” that is actually a strongbox.
    

- After triggering a trap, we open it up with Inda’s and find a potion of mind reading and a journal - Inda’s.
    
- Found an item, started experimentation, logs about how to use the natural order of the universe and fold space, presumably with this item. Lots of failures end in some successes.
    
- Last entry concerns her getting it to successfully fold space (specifically to enhance their ship), though tentative on reliability. Willing to send it anyway for the vine.
    
- After talking to Inda about her journal, she says she works on behalf of some upper planes gamers (specifically mount celestia.) not sure what their goals were w the shard but she got some research done in their stead.
    

- First order of business is Ilren. We bring Cirit who corroborates. Ilren says something in slaad and we post up.
    

- The attack that makes the slaad Garth Brooks
    

- [[Dusty]] hard carries, the slaad teleports away even after two counterspells, and the captain gifts us a charm of relentless endurance. ([[Dusty]] specifically deserves it)
    

- Cool pipe and a note. Here we go
[[Vlaakith Shattered Fang Note]]
    
- URETHRA! 🤓☝️ - [[Serstan]] 
    

- We begin speaking to Figaro, he is concerned about the [[Rod of Seven Parts|Rod]] but is relieved to know that we have it. It seems that his memory has been tampered with in some way causing him to be distant. 
    

- Learned Figaro’s secret! - He charted the course that caused the ship to crash.
    

- We rest again before heading to get the part of the rod. 
    

- We deliberate on whether or not to intercept the meeting between presumably [[Vlaakith]] and Shattered Fang. weal and woe
    

- Heading into the chambers of the heart, we find a fun spyglass!
    

- We see a snakeular creature with the piece of the rod. Time to jump it
    
- [[Nazario]] deals 21 damage while [[Dusty]] deals 300
    
- As [[Dusty]] grabs the piece of the rod, “CAELUM”
    
- “RUAT CAELUM”
    
- Level!
    

-  Creature was a Hertilod. Not dragons, not lizards, much worse. Parasite on dead gods in the astral sea.
    
- We notify morty, he replies “Excellent. Need piece to study. I can meet you in your dreams. Will have next location soon after. Best to stay in Astral for now.”
    

- Back to Inda, she has a solution to dreaming on the astral plane related to Cirit. Coatls have venom that is very helpful in putting people to sleep. Don’t quite trust the dreamscape yet but we’ll bite.
    

- Identify. “Caelum” - piece of the rod. Casts the spell “investiture of wind” DC 18 once per dawn.
    
- The gang schleeps. Dreamscape. Dark room with a desk, [[Mordenkainen]] here with feet kicked up. Book on patterns of the weave.
    

- We hand over the [[Rod of Seven Parts|Rod]] piece for his analysis, and he advises we stay here for now. He commends our progress.
    
- He advises not to go nuts about [[Vlaakith]] but wouldn’t be bad to mess w her.
    
- He casts a variant legend lore, Mordy’s Magnificent Machinations. 
    
- Following the fall of the eisen empire, the far realm creatures were beaten back and the astral sea barred from the main planet. 
    
- Only one who knows of the sealing process are some mortals/mortal souls who saw it happen. Couldn’t be the eisenparty
    
- “[[The Man Out of Time]]” who wanders through the astral sea witnessed everything. Theta-5-0-7 - close to the meeting place. There’s a place to start. 
    
- [[Vlaakith]] may be willing to fight to the “death” so keep that in mind.
    
- We leave the dream.
    

- On to sector theta 5 0 7!
    

- From the crow’s nest - “portside!” we see a rocky mass with a settlement on top. 
    
- “Erm, you guys should take a look at this.”
    
- Small, porcelain-faced creatures snake around different parts of this asteroid and reach a large building. At the top - the [[Cresthall Theatre]]. Mr. Latchkey is there as well.
    

- We’re the special guests. The showing, tonight only - “His Name was Magic”
    

- Things are the same as we remember. 
    
[[His Name Was Magic]]
    
- He hands us the playbill for the play, with the name and a picture of a loom on it. 
    
- As we open the playbill, we see another cipher

[[When The Vessel Breaks...]]
    
- Session over!
