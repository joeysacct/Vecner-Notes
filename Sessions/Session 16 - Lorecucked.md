## Events

- The gang leaves and encounters a crazy old dude with a cool mechanical leg! 
    

- We ask if he knows anyone called the Man out of Time
    
- We ask him about the glass dome ice wall firmament. Redpilling canon btw
    
- Ragebait Manifest
    
- His painting shows stuff happening. He suddenly bursts out laughing at something he sees. Genuine laughter
    
- Illithid (presumably) that was involved in sealing off the astral sea was Netherese (the guy who hmm btw)
    
- Guy had a tentacle face, like a mindflayer but not quite, “different build”. Wanted to do some evil shit w his brain
    
- He offers two octahedral gemstones - ruby red and purple. Red small, purple large, with a swirling mass seemingly in the latter.
    
- Ruby can contain a book’s information with a passphrase. Text appears when observed. Tied to Eberron. 
    

- He remembers that the hmmm guy went somewhere, somewhere, presumably misty/foggy (Barovia?)
    

- PARAMNESIA - the inability to tell apart dreams from reality.
    

- He said that an odd moon flew by a while ago. A fucking moon
    
- We leave, looking for the moon dragon thing, captain says she might know where it is (we immediately find it)
    
- She’ll go to Arkalon if we can help move her
    
- Enlarge Dusty, reduce the moon she lives in, and she opens a slit in spacetime
    
- Get out and push, we make it there
    
- She wants to give us a gift!
    

- She tells of a story she heard in a dream. The room goes dark.
- [[Nyxaris's Dream]]
    

- Serstans back but bro looks like he went to turbo boot camp.
    

- Regenerate is cast
    

- We chill for a bit, cast dream of the blue veil. No themes to be seen here(lie)
    

- A room with a tiles floor and curtains all the way up.
    
- Beyond the curtains - darkness.
    
- Dropping an arrow in, it just falls into nothing.
    
- Down a hallway, we get to another room with a mannequin holding a box. A bit thinner and longer than the first.
    
- Mannequin replaced by a man that looks like Bros, but older, more weathered, and wears an eyepatch over one eye, with the other being milky white.
    
- “A gift for the hungry”. Inside the box: a golden apple.
    
- Ambrose eats the apple. At first sweet, than coppery and metallic. The flesh of the apple covered in blood and a swarm of mealy worms. The man is gone, and the apple is again normal.
    
- In front of bros is a blue curtain. Ambrose has tasted the sweetness of the fruit!
    
-  Cut to Dusty, same room, goes to the smaller room, man that looks like his father is sitting in a leather chair, he gestures to an identical chair ahead of him
    

- Handed a paper, nothing on it. 
    
- Mind filled with a familiar, toothy grin. 
    
- He needs to get going, but says to take care of the paper. Pulls back a blue curtain and slips into the darkness, heels clicking against the floor. 
    
- Dusty reconnected with an old friend!
    
- He gets the worst cipher yet
    

- Onto Nazario, same shit, room with giant hourglass, man inside, trying not to drown in sand
    
- He looks like Naz but featureless
    
- And SWAP, they change places, featureless man leaves (get fucked)
    
- Disengrate, hourglass goes kaboom, and scene ends
    
- Nazario has broken free from the cage of the hourglass
    
- Serstand, same shit, into a bigger room, with 2 dragon (deez nuts) chess sets, one big one small

- Ne7 check, Kh8, Kf6, a3, nf7 checkmate
    
- Checkmate (joey wins)
    
- SERSTAN HAS DESTROYED THE KING WITH THE THREE KNIGHTS
    

- Onto yadeen. Webbed mirror. Reflection looks back from the jagged shapes of the mirror. 
    

- Finger sliced open when touching the mirror. Drop of blood on the mirror where touched that spreads through the cracks. Turns red to quicksilver, restoring the mirror.
    
- In the mirror, behind is a blue curtain.
    
- Yadeen remade the mirror in her image.
    

- We awake in the barracks of the Orion Company in Baldur’s Gate. 
    
- After shopping and chatting with some people, we get Illustrial to pick us up and head to sigil.
    

- Dusty gets a letter from his mom!
    
- Volo begs for what we’ve been up to and we oblige. He gives us a potion of heroism!
    
- And a scroll of Mordenkainen’s Sword
    

- Back to Illustriel to chat.
    

- Yadeen decides to not bring friends. We will remember this.
    
- Azuth again. Pleased with the work so far.
    
- Illustriel is also here. Others as well. 
    
- The seven present are ‘the chosen of mystra’. Temporarily indoctrination in order + a fun new spell.
    
- Selected because mystra said so + needs a new magister of magic. Serves as mortal(maybe not quite mortal) champion of Mystra and balances magical forces in the world. Current magister is unreliable, and wants someone better for the coming of a new age.
    
- Either the current one resigns and offers the position. Name has been struck from reality for those without sufficient power. Other way is to best him in a duel of wizards, decided by Azuth.

- German is canon
    

- Learn about Greatwurms, found in sandier regions of oerth
    

- Another dream. Together this time. Continuing down, a new room larger than the first.
    

- Mordenkainen is here reading a book with a deep blue cover. 2/7 pieces are with him. Behind him is a blue curtain.
    
- He asks what we’re all doing here, and suddenly are dragged back by some force towards a purple curtain. 
    

- Now we’re on Eberron! The title of the book he was reading was “Seeing the Impossible: Behind the Dark Curtain” by Dr Vance “Steps” Obliss
