## Events

- The bald man is [[Mordenkainen]]. The woman with the hat is [[Tasha]] . The other woman is Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]]  Silverhand (daughter of mystra). 
    

- We are now just here from Neverwinter.
    
- THey are very confused that they wished for a way to stop vecna. The result was us. Yikes.
    
- So we’ll run their errands!
    
- The three of them look fatigued. 
    

- [[Vecna]] is likely planning a ritual to unknit reality and remake it how he likes.
    
- They know of an artifact that can fuck him over, though. 
    

- The [[Rod of Seven Parts|Rod]] of Seven Parts (we will be getting these parts i bet)
    
- Each piece tells us where the next is.
    

- Halo ring ass city we’re in. basically on the inside of a car tire. (sigil)
    

- We are chilling in the backstage of reality. Yipes.
    

- We’re doing errands for [[Rod of Seven Parts|Rod]] parts now. 
    

- Dais in their lair works as a permanent portal to several locations. 
    
- Sigil is the city of doors - you can get all kinds of places, but only with the right literal or metaphysical key.
    
- May run into some monsters from the abyss in the underdark. Damn
    
- In Dark Lake, there’s a floating dock that can move us around pretty well. Use that for sure. 
    

- Chime of Exile - once per day, cast banishment. IF the creature has under 50HP, they autofail.
    
- [[Yadeen]]  + [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]]  try to commune w Mystra. 
    

- Gets Azuth instead. Not a bad deal all told
    
- Mystra needs your help. All she needs to save the multiverse is give her your credit card number
    
- And find another macguffin. Wouldn't be dnd without em
    

- The [[Netheril]] are old as hell
    

- Like 3.5 millenia old at least
    
- Spells like fireball are old to even them. 
    
- At some point the [[Netheril]] fell because one of them thought he was as powerful as a god. Tends to not go well when you do that. [[Karsus]] went [[Rampancy|rampant]] and shat the bed there
    

- Passkey is in [[Serstan]] ’s hands - a piece of quartz with smoke inside. 
    

- WE teleport.
    

- We’re at Darklake now.
    

- There’s a rowboat(gorillaman) for us to take. More like a couple but yk. A bead of light in the distance. We set off.
    
- Some creature sniffing in the distance. Not approaching yet
    
- Finns is Fucking Here
    

- Blingdenstone is a good spot, home of the svirfneblin. Recent leadership change to the diggermatics
    
- Grackestew - city of the duergar. Some drow over there too, but they’re not friendly to others.
    
- Neverlight Grove - grove deep down in the underdark. Druids who live there have a good network/knowledge of things.
    
- Menzoberranzan - city of the drow. Lets not. 
    
- Each of these places will have something to do. None are worthless information-wise, and magic items are on the way too.
    

- We fight a nefarious creature. Initiative!
    

- We kill the creature, and eventually get to blingdenstone. 
    

- The wall asks us what our business is. They say to gently fuck off until we reveal that we are badass and kill demons
    
- We are then let in, and see a gnome with a pike and crossbow. He asks us to follow. 
    
- We go through a fuckload of cramped tunnels and eventually get to a comparatively quite nice area. 
    
- We talk to lord and lady diggermattock and show them the removed face of this demon as proof of badassery. Likely an incorrect nabassu.
    
- someone came by here earlier, male drow, looking for info about some operation occurring within the drow world. Not with lolth (inb4 bregan daerthe)
    

- Checking with several non-drow groups in the underdark - next stops were gracklestew and the neverlight grove. 
    

- They give us two rocks! One is an uncut gem from Uncut Gems(adam sandler), and another smoother stone with sigils carved along it. 
    

- Gem of Brightness - This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects: The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem. The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word. When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
    
- Stone of controlling earth elementals - conjure elemental once per day. Guess which fucking elemental
    

- Onto the grove!
    

- We come across a carved obsidian cave filled with purple dinner-plate sized scales. 
    
- Five orangish-brown, fuzzy areas of Rotting Refuse. 
    

- Its a random encounter. 
    

- We genuinely run bc those mfs got hands.
    

- We eventually get to the neverlight grove. 
    
- Session over!
    
- Note: [[Serstan]]  and [[Dusty]] got engulfed by the creatures
