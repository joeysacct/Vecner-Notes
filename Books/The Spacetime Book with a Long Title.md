## The case for an isolate, tachyonic, higher-dimensional space phenomenology - A response to Servius Tiberius Adventus and the persistence and proliferation of dualistic and qualic spacetime

**It has long been assumed by researchers from the primarily material realms that space and time are intertwined universally, their dance inseparable across the firmament of the realms. However, the [[Astral Sea|Astral expanse]] resists such naïve, facile, and obsequious assumptions. Here, movement occurs absent duration; travel is a thought, not a passage, more similar to the text you read now than that of the arduous and laborious act central to locomotion in the material. If the nature of existence within the expanse were to be properly understood, we must divorce the assumption that space demands time to function. This disjunction leads to several key consequences. First, we must address the phenomenon of persistence. A body within the Astral does not grow old, nor does its composition deteriorate. The metabolism of the living and the material, the wear of time itself—both are inert, unchanging. Without the forward momentum of time, the very notion of 'event' loses meaning in its material sense. That is not to say that nothing of note occurs in the lands of the expanse—au contraire mon frere— there are many cases of major occurrings in the expanse. The only challenge is describing the when of any such "event", as any occurrence like that exists entirely outside of the material concept of temporality. In the expanse, the past does not become the present, nor does the present transition to the future. Instead, all is a tableau, motion captured by will rather than servile chronology. Second, we must consider the epistemic implications of navigation. In all other realms, distance is measured as a function of both space and the time required to traverse it, a rather intuitive form of measure for the mortals of the material known sometimes as spacetime. Yet, within the Astral, space is not defined by effort nor endurance but by cognition. A traveler does not move but wills themselves to a new location, circumventing the temporal tether that normally binds space together. Here, 'direction' is not a function of simple celestial or inexorable geometry, but of intent—a self-authored topology wherein destination is an act of thought. And yet, in its very resistance to temporality, the Astral paradoxically preserves time-bound entities. It serves as an archive of sorts, an ossuary of gods forgotten, of travelers lost yet unchanged. It is here we glimpse the strange dualism of its nature: a realm where the past never fades, yet the future never arrives. This is what separates it from mere stasis, for though time is denied, thought persists, shaping the fabric of the plane itself. Some scholars contend this is why deities retreat here in moments of crisis—why the long-forgotten gods linger still, their prayers unanswered, yet their presence undiminished. It is the place where death is impossible, but so too is rebirth. This raises a final and more troubling question: if time is severed from space, then what of causality? If an action does not precede a reaction, then what is the force that binds intent to outcome? Some propose that the Astral Plane is not merely a realm of inert space, but a state of existence beyond temporal determinism, where all events are equally real but selectively perceived. It is neither a past nor a future, but an infinite now. If so, then perhaps the Astral is not simply a realm between realms, but a glimpse into the true nature of existence itself—an existence where time was never necessary to begin with, least of all for the gods themselves**
