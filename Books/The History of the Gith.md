Part One: The Briefest of synopses

In the time before time itself, in the vast expanse of the [[Astral Sea|Astral expanse]], there was a people who had yet to name themselves. They were a race of nomads, wandering the endless expanse of stars and dreams, untethered by the bonds of mortality or the constraints of the physical world. Our current theories lead us to believe that they were either transported to the realm between realms by some other worldly force such as the gods themselves, or were captured and taken by their coleoidine enslavers. As the Astral expanse is a realm of ancient entities, unsleeping minds that existed beyond mortal comprehension, it was not long (or maybe even with any time at all) that this heretofore nameless people become the sole and unique property of the Ilithid Empire, an elder dominion that spanned countless worlds and held entire civilizations in thrall. The Ilithid ruled with an iron will, enslaving the nameless race, bending their minds to the whims of their Elder Brains, and chaining their bodies to the psychic forges where intellect devourers and thralls were born, thereby using them as a breeding stock for Ilithid as well. For centuries untold, the nameless people suffered in silence. Their minds were drained, their memories consumed, their identities reduced to fragments and dust. They labored in the cities of the Ilithid, sleepless, unconsuming, simply livestock. They became vessels, empty of self, filled only with the voices of their masters. But there were some among them who refused to be a vessel. Some who, despite being a slave like the others, a mind lacking of name and purpose, but instead a slave driven to revolution for themselves and all their people. The most powerful among them was named Gith, and with her rise, she gave her people a new name. It is believed by scholars today that it was these ageless eons of breeding and slave labor that forged the sharpened psionic abilities that all of the Gith still possess, at least in some minor form. For Gith, this was a revolution that meant freedom from bonds of any kind. Gith spoke of freedom, of a life unshackled from the tyranny of the Elder Brain. She spoke with a fire that rekindled the ashes of her people’s broken wills. One by one, they began to listen. Gith showed them how to use their psychic gifts, not as shackles but as weapons. She taught them to turn their thoughts into blades, their wills into shields, their very souls into fortresses. She taught them how to use the forges they had been forced to operate into forges for weaponry, especially the silver swords borne by them today. And so the Rebellion of Gith began, today called the Glorious Revolution. It was not just a war of swords and spears but of minds and wills. The Ilithid, masters of mental domination, had never faced such a force, especially in such a numerous force as the Gith. Despite their timelessness within the Astral expanse, the endeavors by the Ilithid on the material planes gave the nameless people plenty of opportunity to grow vast in number, both because of their relatively high fecundity compared to the Ilithid, but also the encouragement of the captors themselves. The Astral expanse trembled with the clash of these psychic powers. Entire cities of the Ilithid fell, their masters driven back by the relentless fury of Gith’s forces, forced beyond match by the Ilithid themselves, and the envy and fear of nearly any other force imaginable. It is oft debated between military historians if the armies of the Demons, the Devil, or the Angels would be enough to stop the fury of the total revolutionary guard of the Gith. Yet, even as they threw off their shackles, another seed took root among Gith’s people. There was one among them who began to question Gith’s leadership, a warrior himself named Zerithmon. Zerithmon was not a coward, nor was he a betrayer. He was a thinker, a philosopher, and he saw what others did not. Gith’s thirst for vengeance grew with each Ilithid city burned, each Elder Brain destroyed. She spoke not of rebuilding their people but of forging an empire, a dominion of warriors that would stretch across the planes. Zerithmon warned his followers that Gith’s path was one of blood and conquest, not freedom. He spoke of temperance, of finding a path to inner clarity, one that did not require the endless spilling of blood. But Gith would not listen. She had tasted power and found it sweet. She had seen her people rise from slaves to conquerors, and she refused to stop until all who had ever oppressed them lay beneath her heel. She declared that they would march upon the very heavens and tear down the gods themselves if they dared stand in her way, disregarding the hubris prominent in that belief. Zerithmon and his followers could not abide this path. They fled to Limbo, a plane of chaos where thought and reality were one and the same. There, they meditated upon the nature of the mind, seeking clarity, seeking balance. They became the Githzerai, meaning Those who Spurn Gith, and became ascetics who wielded their psychic power not to dominate but to understand. And the loyal followers of Gith would be known as the Githyanki, meaning the children of Gith, showing their true devotion to the original leader of the Gith. As the Githzerai marched down to their life within limbo, Gith prepared her people to war with the Nine Hells. There, she sought the power to crush all who opposed her. However, before she could launch her inquisition against the forces of Hell themselves, she was struck from the back. It was her greatest lieutenant, named Vlaakith, meaning Death, in the new Gith language. She sowed dissent among her commanders, and brought a simple deal forward to Gith herself: make an audience with Lady Tiamat of the Dragons, and gain an ally on the inside before the war. Gith, pressured to act by her commanders, went down with a small envoy to meet with Ephelomon, the consort of Tiamat herself. The subject and events of their meeting are rife with speculation, but our best approximation is as follows: One of two things happened. One, He offered Gith a pact, offering that he would grant her the power to unite her people, to forge them into an unstoppable legion that would sweep across the planes. In return, she would serve him in ways unspeakable, her soul bound to his will. Gith accepted without hesitation, sealing a fate far darker than she could have imagined, and being imprisoned by Tiamat until an age in which she would return and bring about a new unholy jihad for the Gith, sending many of the Gith to a prophetic utopia. Or, Two, she was found by Tiamat's guards, captured, and taken and consumed by the Lady of Dragons herself. Either way, Ephelomon returned to the Githyanki, and provided, as he described, Gith's last decree: To follow the path set forth for all githyanki in honing their psionic abilities, and to follow her trusted lieutenant as her second in command, Vlaakith, now Vlaakith I. From here, the story morphed and changed throughout the ages of the githyanki, with the now Title of Vlaakith exchanging hands several times, until finally landing in the hands of a prominent wizard of the Githyanki people, the new [[Vlaakith]], the Undying, still just Vlaakith CLVII (127th). She used her extensive lifespan in the Astral expanse to master the ways and methods of lichdom. From here, Vlaakith used her influence, magic, and undeath to ensure she never faced real challenge from the other githyanki, ever again. She hid her phylactery somewhere no one has ever been able to find it, and rules as the established ruler of the Githyanki in the Court of Bones, her court in the city of Tu'narath, the capital of the Githyanki. She, over incredible spans, morphed the very tradition and history of the Githyanki, placing herself as the eternal ruler of the Githyanki, herself as the betrayed by Gith and Zerithmon both, Herself as the eternal queen of the Githyanki. It is with this power that she wields that she is able to not only remain in power despite challenge, but to also keep herself satiated. She finds those who could pose a challenge to her, no matter how weak, and she offers them salvation. She offers that they may go, with the other githyanki before them, to the utopian afterlife that was promised to them by Gith herself. She then, unceremoniously, consumes their very soul, in the name of relieving their soul to the afterlife. With these powers, Vlaakith is able to act as a dictator, a queen unmatched in loyalty. She controls their history, their faith, their salvation. And, while her constant consumption of the most powerful Githyanki limits her ability to make war as her predecessors have, she beats their longevity by several dozens of orders of magnitude. This, dear reader, is the true history of the Gith.
