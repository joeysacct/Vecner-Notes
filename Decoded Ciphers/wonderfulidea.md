Sorry for the late reply on everything. 
I wanted to let you know that I have taken a few of my friends into [[The Dream|the place]] you were telling me all about. 
We saw all the amazing things you had mentioned. It really is the most wonderful place full of mysteries. We got plenty of experience and more to tell you about our journeys. 
I do have to ask you something. 
Have you all thought about making this into a method of travel? Clearly you all would be smart enough to handle something like that. 
I will leave the details to you in that regard. But imagine being able to travel to anywhere you would like so simply. This could be a wonderful new revelation in our adventures. 
I hope to hear from you soon. 
Also I keep forgetting those weird little [[Litany|litanies]] you write. Please remind me when you get the chance.
