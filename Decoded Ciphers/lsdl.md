(red) Three sevens in a row. The Path is long and dark. You must follow it until the shadows grow long. 

[[L.S.]]
I hope this letter reaches you in time. We have found things you would not believe. Things you could not imagine. I know that We can be a secretive bunch but you really must stop any exploration you are doing. It almost got us killed. Just... Know that this message comes from all of us. You must stop looking. Some [[The Path|paths]] are not meant to be followed. Some pathways lead to nothing but darkness. Now speaking as your friend I can only say this. Where do you think [[Seeing the Impossible - Behind the Dark Curtain|that book]] came from. Who do you think wrote it. Whatever answer you have summoned cannot begin to capture the weight of the reality. Let sleeping dogs lie. I beg you.
    Your ever loyal friend.
