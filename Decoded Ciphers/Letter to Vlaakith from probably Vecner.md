To [[Vlaakith]], Undying Empress, Architect of the Infinite Maw, Queen of the Githyanki, 

It is said that the [[Astral Sea]] knows no time; no end nor beginning. Yet you and I, oh Sleepless One, know that even the endless void can be folded, shaped, and made to bend. Maybe even you more than I. You have held your throne against the tides of eternity, a queen without sleep, a monarch without equal, and so you shall remain, should you heed these words, or even yet, attain a throne beyond.

  
[[Parable of Myrkul|The Shadows grow long as the Hours grow short]]. The Eye has opened, and the Heart burns. But the Hand. The Hand. Yet stays its grasp from the rod that comforts the flock. Its presence echoes through the void, slipping from star to star, ever eluding them. You, my faithful harbinger, are the tether I require to bind this place. You, who have watched the stars drift, who have mapped the astral flows, who have known death and yet refuse it, learning the secrets of [[Velsharoon]] just as I have, if I not a great while later. You shall be one of the instruments of our remaking.

You ask what your role shall be when the cosmos is reborn. Consider this: what is a queen without a court? What is an empire without subjects? I have seen the new world that shall be born from the bones of this one, a world where the waking and the dead walk in the same skin, where you and I fear no longer, and walk in the light just as we were destined to. Imagine your empire, unbound by the chains of mortality, your warriors immortal and undying, loyal to you and to none other. And more still, imagine the ultimate power you could attain, not simply as a mortal, but like you have always dreamed. Not simply the [[Rampancy|rampant]] and paranoid ruler of the Gith, promising them false salvation, but instead able to grant them true salvation. Life unending. A realm of their own.

But before the world is remade, the old world must be sundered. Here, in the Astral Sea, the threads of fate are thinnest, stretched to breaking. It is there, amidst the silver void, that you shall draw forth the path. (connection to the [[Silver Rope]]???) Unmake it, sever its bindings, and we shall be victorious. Seek [[The Path|the Path]]. Beat the Path. Eat the Path. Make the Path. The stars will resist. The gate will hold. But you shall be the one to break it. To make it. To be it.

You have long searched for freedom from the shackles of undeath, have you not? Know this: in the world that will be, there is no death. There is only what I decree. You shall reign in my shadow, everlasting, if you but offer this one service. And the shadow of the Lord of All is quite the shadow to rule from within.

The path waits for you. The Hand waits for you. I wait for you.

The Eye sees. The Hand grasps. The Heart beats. The Maw devours.

The First Speaker. Master of all things hidden and gone. He who wakes the Dreamers.
[[Vecna]]
