(blue) The second of the sevens. Secrets begin to make themselves known.

[[B  ]]
I was overjoyed to find your letter.
I hope you seven are all doing well.
It has been quite a journey so far after you gave me [[Seeing the Impossible - Behind the Dark Curtain|this book]].
I hope my delay in writing you hasnt caused any problems with old sour puss yet.
He can be quite the spoil sport with all our mischief but he always means well.
Any who I went following those [[The Path|paths]] you mentioned and the source from this book.
Truly fascinating stuff. Ive done some branching out too.
Always about the same as what you all saw. So strange.
The silence and the stillness is something Ive never really seen before.
Will do some more looking while you all are away.
I cant wait for your next letter about all your adventures.
Ta ta as you say.
