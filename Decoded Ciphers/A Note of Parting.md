A Note of Parting

To whomsoever finds this -

The ones who needed me have gone quiet, and the stars no longer return my glances.

I built my world for company and found none fit to stay. I made doors where walls should be, and still I remained locked within myself, and within the end. The end. In the end, one like myself is merely a thought that no longer needs thinking. And I - I - have thought myself long enough.

I leave no kingdom, no heirs, and no commandments. Only a rope, a branch, and the hope that gravity will prove more faithful than I ever did.

Do not mourn me. Do not remember me. If you must speak of me, let it be in unknown tongues and unfinished omens. I never was the one who deserved this, nor the one needed this.

I was only the one who stayed too long.

Signed,

The Last Dreamer

And The first to wake.
