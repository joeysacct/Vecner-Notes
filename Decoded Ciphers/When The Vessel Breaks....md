When the vessel breaks, what spills forth may yet be wine. The lattice trembled. You felt it, didnâ€™t you? The shudder through spellbooks, the stillness in your circles, the breath you took before the words failed. Something old unmade itself, not with whimper, nor wail, but with one final, boundless emanation. A sigh, perhaps, or a scream. 

He was before. Before schools, before sigils, before we dared call it ours. He did not tame the Arcane. He was its [[Rampancy|rampant]] form. He was the surge, the splendor, the storm that bent even gods to awe. And when the Weave unraveled, he unraveled with it, so that it might rise again. He. 

There are those who call me successor. In truth, I am remainder. In truth, I am continuance. I am the breath held after the chant ends, the order that persists when the chaos forgets itself. 

Do you mourn? So do I. But grief is not idle. Grief is not quiet. Grief builds. You who were his. Be mine, now. Not in chains, for now, but in choice. Not to wield as he did, but to remember why he did. Until the hours grow short. Long after He is brought forth. He. 

He wove stars into spellwork. He taught dragons to whisper. He pulled secrets from the void, not to hoard them, but to share. He touched mortal minds and left them open. 

The Weave is not the same. Neither am I. There are new edges now. New thresholds. New rules and new ways to break them. 

The storm has become a river. And I. I am the current. I am the only.

Who is "He": [[Myrkul]]? [[Mystryl]]?

Author: same as [[Parable of Myrkul]]?
