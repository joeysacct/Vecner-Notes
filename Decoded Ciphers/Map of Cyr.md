Today, Class, we will be discussing: /The Map of Cyr/...

/The Map of Cyr/ led those who walked the path to great power and strength. Their powers grow, and with it, their despair. They remain hidden and gone, but the find their rhythm. They beat the path. They make it their own. /The Map of Cyr/ leads them to the great power and riches that they seek, whatever they may be. But it comes with a cost. A great cost. Following /The Map of Cyr/ is often a decision made with regret in retrospect. But, many still make the journey, for the path is great and terrible.

almost an anagram of [[Rampancy]]?
