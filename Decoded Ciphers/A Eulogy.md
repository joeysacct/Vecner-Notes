All four sevens in a row. You have done all that you thought possible, yet [[The Path]] still remains. Beat the Path...

to those who remain, what is there to say about these seven that has not already been said?
their support has made our group what it is today.
it is with their support that we are able to be here today, to stand upon their shoulders and see all the pathways in front of us.
we cannot forget their sacrifice, nor can we forget the charge they left to us all.
we must keep our eyes open and our hands ready for whatever crosses our [[The Path|path]].
as he often said, [[Litany|"as the shadows grow long and the hours grow short, may they go in peace."]]
