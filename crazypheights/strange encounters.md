Six sevens in a row. The Path is long and dark. You must follow it until the shadows grow long.

WE HAVE SO FAR ENCOUNTERED SOME STRANGE FELLOWS IN THAT PECULIAR PLACE 
OUR FIRST OUTING SEEMED INTRIGUING AND FRUITFUL 
OUR SECOND WAS LESS SO 
AS WE TRAVELED WE KEPT FINDING OURSELVES SEPARATED AND THEN AGAIN TOGETHER 
FINALLY WE CAME UPON A BUILDING IN THAT STRANGE PLACE 
LIKE A WAREHOUSE 
WE MET A VERY STRANGE MAN WITH VERY STRANGE IDEAS AND HE GAVE US THIS BOOK AND TOLD US TO GO SEE FOR OURSELVES 
TO FOLLOW THE PATH
THAT IS WHAT HE SAID 
FOLLOW THE PATH
I HOPE WHEREVER THIS PATH LEADS WILL BE MORE FRUITFUL 
HIS ASSOCIATES SEEMED LIKE THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO SAY 
HE GIVES ME A BAD FEELING
